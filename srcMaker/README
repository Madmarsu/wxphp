parser.php:

Code generator, this takes the class mapping (classes, methods and arguments) and 
generates corresponding source code.
This script currently as the following file dependencies/templates:
	wxwidgets.c
	php_wxwidgets.h
It takes two arguments
	1 - the filename of the file with the serialized classes
	2 - the filename of the file with the serialized constants
	
ex: php parser.php classes.out consts.dump
	

The generated file ".c" and ".h" are meant to replace the ones in the module source root.

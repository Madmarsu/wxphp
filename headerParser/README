run.php:

This script takes the output of gccxml (http://www.gccxml.org/) "wx.xml", 
and produces 2 files "consts.dump" and "classes.dump". These files contain
a serialized mapping interpretation of the library methods, and constants.

It's usefull, but it's not complete. There are some problems at variable types 
interpretation. Every time that happens, the type is replaced by a "ref: [0-9]+"
string.

The output of this script, is the input for srcMaker/srcGui scripts.

In linux:
gccxml teste.c -fxml=testing.xml -I/usr/lib/wx/include/gtk2-unicode-release-2.8 -I/usr/include/wx-2.8 -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D_LARGE_FILES -D__WXGTK__ -I/usr/include/php5 -I/usr/include/php5/main -I/usr/include/php5/TSRM -I/usr/include/php5/Zend -I/usr/include/php5/ext -I/usr/include/php5/ext/date/lib
